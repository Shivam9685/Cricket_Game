# Cricket_Game
The main goal of this project was to create a fun and interactive cricket game
where users can choose different teams and enjoy both batting and bowling, just
like in a real match.

I used Python with Pygame, Numpy, and the Time module.
Pygame made it easy to handle user inputs and manage game events, while
Numpy helped with handling arrays, like tracking scores. I also used the Time
module to control how fast the game runs, keeping the gameplay smooth.

 Initialization: The game begins with team selection, where users choose
from teams like India, Australia, and England. Players are assigned roles with
attributes like batting and bowling skills, and the game sets up scores and player
statistics.

 Game Flow: Game Flow: The game runs in a loop, processing real-time
user inputs for actions like batting and bowling. Players use keyboard inputs to
control these actions, such as pressing specific keys to hit the ball. The game
continuously updates the game state and scores.

 End of Match: The game concludes when a win, loss, or tie condition is
met. Final scores and player statistics are displayed, and users can choose to
restart or exit.
